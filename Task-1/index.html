            <h3>Pig Game</h3>
            <p>
              The Pig game is a simple dice game where players take turns to
              roll a six-sided die as many times as they wish, accumulating
              points with each roll. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose
              all points for that turn and their turn ends. Players can choose
              to hold their score at any time, adding the turn's points to their
              total score. The first player to reach a predetermined score,
              usually 100 points, wins the game. Pig is a fun, strategic game
              that combines luck with risk management.

            <p>
              A simple login system is a basic authentication mechanism used to
              verify the identity of users accessing a particular application or
              website. It typically involves users entering a unique username or
              email address and a corresponding password. The system then checks
              these credentials against a database to ensure they match. If the
              credentials are correct, the user is granted access; otherwise,
              access is denied. Simple login systems are fundamental for
              ensuring security and protecting user data.
